# hub-v2

This repository contains the rebranded Skadoosh's Hub frontend (derived from the uploaded project).

- **Keep in mind:** All CDN and asset URLs (jsDelivr/GitHub) were left intact so the games keep working.
- **Files:** `index.html` is the main file. Favicon link remains unchanged—keep your favicon at the same path if you rely on it.

## Deploy
You can deploy this folder to GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or Netlify. Example (GitHub Pages):

1. Create a new repo and push these files.
2. Enable GitHub Pages from the repo settings.

## Notes
- The theme uses a leafy pastel green palette and preserves the original functionality (ads, analytics, tab cloak).
- If you want any further tweaks (change footer contact, swap favicon, adjust colors), tell me and I’ll update the files.
